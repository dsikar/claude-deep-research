## Conclusion

While the March-April 2025 weekend concert calendar in NYC isn't overwhelming with options under $150, there are several high-quality performances worth considering. The Bowery Ballroom offers the best value with tickets generally under $50, while larger venues like Barclays Center have limited options under our price threshold.

Highlights include the rare co-headlining tour of 90s indie rock veterans Ida and Tsunami at the Bowery Ballroom on March 29, and Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds with St. Vincent at Barclays Center on April 17 (though technically not a weekend show).

For concert-goers with flexible budgets, the Charli XCX shows at Barclays Center beginning April 30 (continuing into May) would be worth considering, though tickets start at $120 and are in high demand.

Recommended best value: Weatherday with Combat, Bedridden, and Ogbert the Nerd at Bowery Ballroom on March 7, with tickets at just $29 plus fees.
